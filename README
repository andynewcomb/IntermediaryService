Summary: 
Intermediary API Service that takes requests from a user to initiate a transaction on a fictitious third party service.
The transaction can take up to 10 days to complete. 
Users can send a POST to start the transaction.
Users can send a GET to receive status updates.
Try the live application running in Azure by using PostMan (https://www.getpostman.com/) to send requests.

-----Endpoint1 (send a post to the following URL with the following JSON object in the body of the request)
POST https://intermediaryservicefirst.azurewebsites.net/request?code=IIDziKrTjabXroyONqLJkH1/4QD/ccPgcRt2m8Z0ia/7MN3G2TEyaw==
{
"body":"This is a sample document"
}
You should receive back a GUID that represents the created document.


-----Endpoint2 (send a post to the following URL with the string "STARTED" in the body (without quotes)). 
Note: Replace {guid} in the URL with the guid returned from Endpoint1 above.
POST https://intermediaryservicefirst.azurewebsites.net/{guid}/ThirdParty?code=/D3vup4U0eHfyeTL/NcAbKbr6LpGaSPLUICsAhTYZqZcVFTXp7v6Ow==
This simulates the third-party making a request to the API and should return a 204 response.


-----Endpoint3 (send a PUT to the following URL with the below JSON object in the body of the request)
Note: Replace {guid} in the URL with the guid returned from endpoint1 above.
PUT https://intermediaryservicefirst.azurewebsites.net/{guid}/ThirdParty?code=lmmAO2AGjgMARaqTp6e66PPZnlY/sV4rOinSPhnaPaVXGOjfhzaKEQ==
{
"Status":"PROCESSED",
"Detail":"Completed on time"
}
You should receive a 204 response. This simulates the third party application giving status updates.


-----Endpoint4 (send a GET to the following URL to obtain the status of any document
Note: Replace {guid} in the URL with the guid returned from Endpoint1 above.
GET https://intermediaryservicefirst.azurewebsites.net/status/{guid}?code=WvllT7a4N2obxuAVY2RbfbbjUrY5AveUdJYkO9J2ygSNvZtF1Jq3zQ==


Notes/Prerequisites: 
This application is a coding challenge and does not actually access a third party service.
Both the local application and the application running on Azure use the same CosmosDb in Azure.

*Visual Studio 2019 -
Visual studio 2019 or later running on a windows machine with the "Azure Development" workload

*Instructions: 
clone the repository
open IntermediaryService.sln in visual studio 2019
Click the green "run" triangle to start the application.
A console window will appear showing the localhost URLs for the 4 API endpoints.
Use Postman to test the local endpoints using the same instructions when trying the live application on Azure.
